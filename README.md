Content Based Image Retrieval Techniques (e.g. knn, svm using MatLab GUI)
When cloning the repository you'll have to create a directory inside and name it images. Inside that directory you're gonna put your images which in comprise your dataset.

If you don't have anyone you can use the wang dataset which is the one I use to demonstrate the above techniques.

You can download it from here: http://wang.ist.psu.edu/docs/related/
